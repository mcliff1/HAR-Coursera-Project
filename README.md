# HAR-Coursera-Project
Machine Learning Course project on classifying quality of exercise using HAR (Human Activity Reporting) data

## Getting Started

The [harExerciseQuality.Rmd] markdown can be opened and run, you will need a multicore machine with at least 4 GB or RAM.  On my local workstation this would take about an hour to run.


## Data

The training data is available here (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv), the test data is available (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

The data for this project came from the source (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.bar/har) which tracks Human Activity observations.
